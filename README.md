<h3 align="center">Plant Monitor System</h3>

  <p align="center">
    With the power of an Ardunio Uno, this project focues on managing the enviroment for a potted plant. It is achived through various sensors and devices to water, light, and manage the plant.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Arduino powered plant monitoring system which utilizes sensors and devices to manage care of a plant. The system will track and analyze the data and react to certain conditions. This includes watering pump when the soil moisture become to low. 

This is a side project for me to learn C++, Arduino, and some hardware skills. (Also to keep my plants alive)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This projects purpose is to become comfortable with C++, Ardunio, and see real life results from code. 

It has transformed into a project which might help lots of people who tend to forget about their house plants.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [‚úîÔ∏è] Tempuature and Humidity Displayed on LCD
- [‚úîÔ∏è] Soil is dry the water pump will turn on until moisture is at acceptable levels
- [‚úîÔ∏è] LED indicators to quickly and easily see status
- [] Button to change the dryness threshold
- [] Create a case for the system
- [] Include buttons to manually water
- [] Fan and lighting controls

See the [open issues](https://github.com/Gabeele/Plant-Monitor-System/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
